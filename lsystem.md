# ðŸŒ¸ Kolam Drawing Principles

### **Rule 1** â€“ Uniform spacing of dots

Dots are arranged with equal spacing, usually in square, rhombic, triangular, or custom arrangements.

### **Rule 2** â€“ Smooth drawing line around the dots

The drawing must curve smoothly around the dots, without sharp discontinuities.

### **Rule 3** â€“ Symmetry in drawings

Kolams are typically symmetric, either horizontally, vertically, diagonally, or radially.

### **Rule 4** â€“ Straight lines inclined at 45Â°

Whenever straight lines occur, they are inclined at a 45Â° angle relative to the grid.

### **Rule 5** â€“ No retracing

The drawing line never goes back over an already drawn line.

### **Rule 6** â€“ Arcs adjoining the dots

Dots are joined through smooth arcs wrapping around them.

### **Rule 7** â€“ Completion rule

A kolam is complete only when all dots are enclosed by a continuous drawing line.

### **Rule 8** - Color rule

Color Command (C) Placement Rules:
1. Position Independence: C can be placed anywhere in the L-system string
2. Non-Spatial: C does not affect turtle position, heading, or geometric structure
3. State Modifier: C toggles between white mode (default) and colorful mode
4. Persistence: Color state persists until next C command is encountered
5. Expansion Immunity: C remains unchanged during L-system iterations
6. Multiple Usage: Multiple C commands create alternating color segments
7. Strategic Placement:
   - Beginning (CFBFB): Entire pattern starts colorful
   - Middle (FBCFB): Color transition partway through
   - Symmetric (CFBCFBC): Balanced color alternation
   - End (FBFBC): Ends with color change (affects recursive expansions)

Example Color Patterns:
- "FBFBFBFB" â†’ All white strokes (default)
- "CFBFBFBFB" â†’ All colorful strokes
- "FBCFBCFB" â†’ White-Color-White alternation
- "CABACABA" â†’ Colorful arcs and petals only
- "FCBCACBC" â†’ Color toggle before each different element type

Advanced Placement Strategies:
1. Sectional Coloring: Place C before major structural elements (A, B)
2. Rhythmic Patterns: Regular C intervals for breathing color rhythm
3. Hierarchical Coloring: Different colors for different recursion levels
4. Symmetrical Balance: Mirror C placement for visual harmony
5. Emphasis Control: Use C to highlight specific pattern features

# ðŸ”— Kolam as a Graph

* A kolam can be treated as a **special graph**:

  * Crossings = vertices
  * Line segments between crossings = edges

* Restrictions:

  * Unlike general graphs, edges must follow the kolamâ€™s construction rules.

* **Single-knot kolam (Anthathi Kolam)**:

  * A kolam drawn with **one unbroken line**.
  * Graphically equivalent to an **Eulerian graph**:

    * Starts and ends at the same vertex.
    * Passes through every edge exactly once.

* Such kolams can be drawn for **any dot arrangement** (square, rhombic, triangular, or free-form).

# ðŸŒ± L-System for Kolam Generation

### What is an L-System?

* A **parallel rewriting system** (formal grammar).

* Uses:

  * Alphabet (symbols)
  * Production rules (replace symbols with longer strings)
  * Recursive expansion â†’ self-similar, fractal-like structures.

* Kolam patterns can be generated by applying L-systems iteratively.

---

### **Kolam L-System Setup**

**Axiom (initiator):**

```
FBFBFBFB
```

**Rules:**

* `A â†’ AFBFA`
* `B â†’ AFBFBFBFA`

**Drawing commands:**

* `F` â†’ Move forward 10 units (draw line)
* `A` â†’ Draw arc (circle(10, 90))
* `B` â†’

  1. Compute step `I = 5 / âˆš2`
  2. Forward `I` units
  3. Draw arc (circle(I, 270))
  4. Forward `I` units

---

### **Execution Example**

**0th Iteration (Initiator):**

```
FBFBFBFB
```

**1st Iteration:** (applying `B â†’ AFBFBFBFA`)

```
F AFBFBFBFA F AFBFBFBFA F AFBFBFBFA F AFBFBFBFA
```

**2nd Iteration:** (applying `A â†’ AFBFA` and `B â†’ AFBFBFBFA`)

```
FAFBFA FAFBFBFBFA FAFBFBFBFA FAFBFBFBFA FAFBFA
FAFBFA FAFBFBFBFA FAFBFBFBFA FAFBFBFBFA FAFBFA
FAFBFA FAFBFBFBFA FAFBFBFBFA FAFBFBFBFA FAFBFA
FAFBFA FAFBFBFBFA FAFBFBFBFA FAFBFBFBFA FAFBFA
```

**Further Iterations:**

* Continue expanding recursively.
* With each iteration, the kolam pattern becomes more intricate.
